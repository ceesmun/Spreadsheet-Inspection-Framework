# Descriptions
PolicyConstants.0001 = Constants In Formulas
PolicyConstants.0002 = Checks whether formulas contain constant values.
PolicyConstants.0003 = Constant values are not always as constant as they seem in the beginning. In case their values change, it can be hard to adjust the constants consistently in the spreadsheet.
PolicyConstants.0004 = Extract the constants into to separate cells and reference these cells.

# Descriptions
PolicyReadingDirection.0001 = Reading direction
PolicyReadingDirection.0002 = Checks whether formulas reference only cells to the left and above.
PolicyReadingDirection.0003 = Formula cells should only reference cells to the left or above as this is the normal western reading direction.
PolicyReadingDirection.0004 = Move the cell with the formula or the cells referenced by it.

# Violations
PolicyReadingDirection.0010 = The following referenced cell is right of this cell:
PolicyReadingDirection.0011 = The following referenced cell is below this cell:
